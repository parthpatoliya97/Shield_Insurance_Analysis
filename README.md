- Analyze month-over-month policy performance

- Reposition policies for under-30 customers — low revenue and weak engagement.
- Scale Offline Agent channel — strongest revenue and customer acquisition engine.
- Urgently improve Online Website experience — lowest adoption and revenue contribution.
- Optimize POL2005HEL pricing & marketing — high revenue but poor customer penetration.
- Revamp POL4321HEL — high customers but extremely low revenue indicates low ticket size.
- Focus expansion in Tier-2 cities like Indore — lowest revenue and customer base.
- Replicate Delhi NCR sales strategy — proven high-performing city model.
- Run seasonal campaigns in November — weakest month for revenue and customers.
- Leverage March peak patterns — replicate offers, timing, and agent incentives year-round.
